# Scientific Notation

Mathematical logic is used in scientific papers for several key reasons:

1. Precision: It provides an exact way to express relationships, hypotheses, and conclusions without ambiguity
2. Verification: Mathematical proofs allow other researchers to verify claims systematically
3. Quantification: It helps measure and analyze data, showing statistical significance and correlations
4. Modeling: Complex systems and phenomena can be represented through mathematical models
5. Prediction: Mathematical formulas enable predictions about future outcomes or untested scenarios

This formal approach helps ensure research is rigorous, reproducible, and can be built upon by other scientists.

## Dice Probability

Probability of rolling any single number (e.g., getting a 6):
$$
P(X = 6) = \frac{1}{6}
$$
Probability of rolling an even number:
$$
P(X \in \{2,4,6\}) = \frac{|\{2,4,6\}|}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$
Probability of rolling a number greater than 4:
$$
P(X > 4) = \frac{|\{5,6\}|}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
$$
For two dice (X and Y), probability of sum being 7:
$$
P(X + Y = 7) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
$$
Expected value of a single die roll:
$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} i \cdot P(X = i) = \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5
$$
